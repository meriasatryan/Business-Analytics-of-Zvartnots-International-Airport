Flight Data Analysis Project README

Group: Meri Asatryan, Lili Kostanyan, Jeni Balaban

Project Overview:
Welcome to the Flight Data Analysis project, where we meticulously explore curated flight data from Zvartnots International Airport. Our project aims to extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, basic analysis, time series analysis, advanced ARIMA modeling, and Tableau visualizations.

Project Goal:
Our goal is to provide actionable insights and foresight into patterns, trends, and performance metrics of flights departing from Zvartnots International Airport.

Data Cleaning:
We start with meticulous data cleaning to ensure reliability and consistency. Operations include merging datasets, handling missing values, and creating new columns for enhanced analytics, resulting in a refined dataset ready for exploration.

Merging Datasets: Integrating disparate data sources for a holistic view.
Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing values without bias.
Creating New Columns: Introducing variables to enrich analysis perspectives.
Basic Analysis:
We conduct fundamental analysis to unravel key aspects of the dataset, such as identifying popular destinations, evaluating flight frequency, and visualizing distribution and airline performance through intuitive bar charts.

Identifying Popular Destinations: Examining travel preferences considering various factors.
Flight Frequency Evaluation: Understanding flight frequency trends over time.
Visualizing Distribution and Airline Performance: Presenting narratives through visualizations.
Time Series Analysis:
Delving into time series analysis, we uncover temporal patterns and trends using techniques like moving averages, differencing, and autocorrelation plots. We meticulously evaluate stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test, paving the way for advanced ARIMA modeling.

ARIMA Modeling:
Employing advanced time series analysis through ARIMA modeling, we make insightful predictions by fitting models based on differencing and autocorrelation. Visualizations showcase the effectiveness of ARIMA in forecasting future flight counts, with the critical analysis of Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).

Tableau Visualizations:
We strategically incorporate Tableau to enrich the depth and clarity of our analysis, presenting the distribution of flight destinations in an interactive manner. Stakeholders can explore intricate flight patterns dynamically, enhancing interpretability and deriving actionable insights.

Code Highlights:
Our Python code demonstrates proficiency in data science and analytics using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib. It serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts seeking to expand their skills in data science.

Conclusion:
The Flight Data Analysis project offers a comprehensive resource for extracting actionable insights from flight data. Whether exploring popular destinations, evaluating airline performance, or forecasting future flight counts, our project provides a robust foundation for further analysis, encouraging exploration and adaptation based on specific analytical needs.
